                                </p>
                                <p>They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from
                                    our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As
                                    you think,
                                    so
                                    shall you be.”
                                </p>
                                <p>If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the
                                    power of
                                    thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives,
                                    including our
                                    financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible
                                    as
                                    thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
                                </p>
                                <p>We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
                                    Prosperity is
                                    a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this
                                    train of
                                    thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
                                </p>
                                <p>Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract
                                    more
                                    prosperity into your life:
                                </p>
                                <p>Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
                                    express
                                    heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a
                                    few of
                                    these
                                    blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on
                                    abundance,
                                    not
                                    lack.
                                </p>
                                <p>Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
                                    statements
                                    such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them
                                    nightly
                                    before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind,
                                    and you
                                    will begin to naturally believe them.
                                </p>
                                <p>Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you
                                    wish to
                                    achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the
                                    same way
                                    affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and
                                    eventually these
                                    subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being
                                    prosperous, and
                                    you
                                    will become so.
                                </p>
                                <p>Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also
                                    be one
                                    of
                                    your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell
                                    yourself
                                    you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will
                                    gain the
                                    confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe
                                    you can
                                    do
                                    it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly
                                    successful.
                                    Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts
                                    Like. Even
                                    if
                                    you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will
                                    begin to
                                    build
                                    up and attract more money.
                                </p>
                                <p>Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is
                                    such that
                                    we
                                    lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
                                    will
                                    create
                                    more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
                                </p>
                                <p>Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one
                                    day. But
                                    over
                                    time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once
                                    you
                                    master
                                    this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!

                                <p>Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party.
                                    Both
                                    walk
                                    to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and

                                    because they
                                    are
                                    engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and

                                    their path. Which type of person would you like to model your business after?
                                </p>
                                <p>Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you
                                    know it
                                    or
                                    not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
                                    competitors,
                                    that
                                    will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your
                                    client’s minds
                                    so
                                    that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to people.
                                </p>
                                <p>Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and
                                    keeping it
                                    there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
                                    Frequency
                                    is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of
                                    both
                                    television
                                    and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase
                                    or
                                    musical
                                    jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are absolutely sick
                                    of
                                    hearing
                                    it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is
                                    expensive,
                                    it
                                    can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high. Television and
                                    radio can
                                    reach
                                    a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are
                                    paying to
                                    market to both those that are your potential customers and a large segment of those
                                    who are
                                    not
                                    now and probably never will be your customers.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your
                                    target
                                    market
                                    demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
                                    seen by
                                    them.
                                </p>
                                <p>Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out
                                    from my
                                    competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
                                    yourself in
                                    a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd,
                                    and
                                    ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying
                                    goes,
                                    “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising budget
                                    for the
                                    year,
                                    try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full year
                                    of your
                                    advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short term
                                    gains for
                                    that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with
                                    the
                                    impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so
                                    long.
                                </p>
                                <p>Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open
                                    for
                                    the
                                    latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology
                                    coming down
                                    dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are
                                    becoming
                                    more
                                    and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the
                                    past. With
                                    the
                                    flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage with computer
                                    generated
                                    graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a
                                    good look.
                                    Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the door” of your
                                    business
                                    (or
                                    on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and
                                    effort
                                    up
                                    front any way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target
                                    market,
                                    the
                                    payoffs will be worth it.
